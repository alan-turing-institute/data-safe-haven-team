# Data Safe Haven progress report October 2024 to March 2025

## Introduction

Creating file for 6 monthly report, associated to ELA phase closedown and final report of DSP as RPM.

This report will have up to two reporting formats in the same file,
the first one will follow internal Turing structure and is a necessary part of the formal closedown of this phase
as well as part of the RPM leaving exercise.

### Summary

Safe access to and productive use of sensitive data sets has been a long-standing challenge across academia,
government,
industry,
and the third sector.
This has been particularly highlighted with the critical role sensitive data has played in the UK and international pandemic response. 

There is widespread recognition that access to data to support research and government decision making needs to be made easier.
However,
the reaction to the government’s recent proposal to share GP records more widely is also a reminder that retaining societal consent for the use of personal data is critical as we seek to make access to data more widespread. 

Trustworthy Research Environments (TREs) such as the Data Safe Haven are a critical part of safely providing more widespread access to data and there has been much high profile activity in this area recently,
including the HDR UK work on standards for TREs and the Goldacre review into the use of health data,
with TREs even being mentioned in parliament by the health secretary.
This is a clear example of where we can engage with others to play a lead role in a national priority area. 

Development of the Turing’s Safe Haven over the past 7 years has resulted in an open source,
re-usable platform that supports the deployment of secure,
scalable,
cloud-based secure research environments supporting a range of compute capability and the full suite of data science software and tooling required to do leading edge data science research securely and at scale.
Our platform has been deployed at multiple other organisations,
including Nottingham University and one of the NHS Sub-National Secure Data Environments (SN-SDEs).
The Turing’s own deployment of the platform has been compliant with the NHS Data Security Protection Toolkit (DSPT) for the past two years,
and further work is continuing to certify the system against other standards to enable its deployment at a wider range of partner organisations.

Recently the DSH has been awarded a grant to develop a new Kubernetes codebase, 
the FRIDGE project will develop a new TRE based on the learning of DSH that can be deployed on any platforms and specifically targets High-Performance Computing Centres. 
The team is working with both existign AIRR sites on its development.

On top of the technical development the project has led on establishing a vibrant UK Trusted Research Environment (TRE) Community with over 250 members,
and the development of the first TRE standards (SATRE - in collaboration with University of Dundee, UCL, Research Data Scotland and University of Ulster).
These standards are being progressively adopted across the community, including by NHS England as the basis for the standards for its 11 Secure Data Environments (SDEs).
The UK TRE Community has engaged enthusiastically with the development and adoption of the SATRE standards,
and a working group has been set up within the UK TRE Community to maintain momentum on this work.
It is anticipated that both the standards and community work Turing has been leading will be strong contenders for future funding from DARE as part of its Phase 2 work.
