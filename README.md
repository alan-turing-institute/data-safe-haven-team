## New starters checklist

Welcome to the Data Safe Haven team! ðŸŽ‰

You should read this page and follow the instructions if you're joining the project for the first time at The Alan Turing Institute.

### First steps

1. Bookmark this page and the other [useful links](#useful-links) above
2. On the [documentation site](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-safe-haven), click the `Overview` tab, where you will find links to resources that explain what Data Safe Haven is and why someone would want to use it.
    - In particular, it's worth studying the [diagram](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Data_Safe_Havens_in_the_Cloud/11815224) which displays the overall architecture of DSH, including the distinction between the Safe Haven Management (SHM) and Secure Research Environments (SREs) and the data classification system.
3. Ask one of the existing Data Safe Haven team to create a non-privileged user account in any test SRE that may be set up, so you can log in explore it from a user perspective and familiarise yourself with how it works.
