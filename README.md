## New starters checklist

Welcome to the Data Safe Haven team! ðŸŽ‰

You should read this page and follow the instructions if you're joining the project for the first time at The Alan Turing Institute.

### First steps for *all starters*

1. **Bookmark** this page and the other [useful links](#useful-links) above
2. **Read up:** On the [documentation site](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-safe-haven), click the `Overview` tab, where you will find links to resources that explain what Data Safe Haven is and why someone would want to use it.
    - In particular, it's worth studying the [diagram](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Data_Safe_Havens_in_the_Cloud/11815224) which displays the overall architecture of DSH, including the distinction between the Safe Haven Management (SHM) and Secure Research Environments (SREs) and the data classification system.
3. **Access:** We have internal discussions about the project via Slack and manage our work via a combination of GitHub and Microsoft Sharepoint:
    - **Slack:** Ensure you have access to the Alan Turing Institute Slack workspace and join the following channels: `#data-safe-haven` and `#data-safe-haven-team` (the latter is private and you may need to request a team member to add you, see [contacts](#contacts)).
    - **Slack:** You can also join the external-facing Slack workspace called `Turing Data Safe Haven`, used for release announcements and other communications with the community of DSH users. Ask a team member to add you (see [contacts](#contacts)).
    - **Sharepoint:** Internal documents are stored on [sharepoint](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/sites/SafeHaven). You will need to have your Turing SSO set up. Ask a team member to add you to the group with access rights (see [contacts](#contacts)).
    - **GitHub:** We use a GitHub [project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/40/views/1) to manage who is working on what. [Familiarise yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) if you haven't used one before and check you can add issues to the `data-safe-haven-team` or `data-safe-haven` repos from the project board view.
4. **Explore:** Ask one of the existing Data Safe Haven team to create a non-privileged user account in any test SRE that may be set up, so you can log in explore it from a user perspective and familiarise yourself with how it works.

### Next steps for *developers*

1. **Deploy:** The best way to familiarise yourself with the codebase is to have a go at deploying either an SRE to an existing SHM, or if time permits, a new SHM and attached SRE. Click on the `Deployment` tab and in the [DSH documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/data-safe-haven/) and follow the guides available there. Either choose the latest release docs or try `develop` if you're feeling adventurous!
    - Note: When you're done with any test SHM/SREs, you should follow the "Tear down" instructions in the respective guides.
2. **Open issues:** If you notice any bugs in the Safe Haven code when deploying an SHM or SRE, open them [on the main repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/issues).
